iCalendar 0.11 (2005-11-08)
===========================

* Changed component .from_string to use types_factory instead of
  hardcoding entries to 'inline'

* Changed UTC tzinfo to a singleton so the same one is used everywhere

* Made the parser more strict by using regular expressions for key
  name, param name and quoted/unquoted safe char as per the RFC

* Added some tests from the schooltool icalendar parser for better
  coverage

* Be more forgiving on the regex for folding lines

* Allow for multiple top-level components on .from_string

* Fix vWeekdays, wasn't accepting relative param (eg: -3SA vs -SA)

* vDDDTypes didn't accept negative period (eg: -P30M)

* '\N' is also acceptable as newline on content lines, per RFC
