iCalendar 0.10 (2005-04-28)
===========================

* moved code to codespeak.net subversion.

* reorganized package structure so that source code is under 'src'
  directory. Non-package files remain in distribution root.

* redid doc/*.py files as doc/*.txt, using more modern doctest. Before
  they were .py files with big docstrings.

* added test.py testrunner, and tests/test_icalendar.py that picks up
  all doctests in source code and doc directory, and runs them, when
  typing:

  python2.3 test.py

* renamed iCalendar to lower case package name, lowercased,
  de-pluralized and shorted module names, which are mostly
  implementation detail.

* changed tests so they generate .ics files in a temp directory, not
  in the structure itself.
